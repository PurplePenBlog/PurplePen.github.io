            <p>Welcome to Purple Pen, my personal space to spew out all my thoughts in a (hopefully) entertaining manner.</p>

            <h2>My Background</h2>

            <p> I'm an odd bird, I studied art, before moving to computer science, before finally deciding to double major in economics and business management. I worked as a journalist for a national news outlet, a product manager for a gaming start-up, a programmer for that same start up, an English teacher in a few middle schools and currently I'm a research assistant at a top university.</p>
            
            <p>But I'm not going to talk here only about my professional life. Lets start with some light trivia, my iq is 140~, my myers briggs personality type is currently INTJ, I'm a cancer, my favorite video game of all time is the "Banner Saga Trilogy", my favorite movie is "The Princess Bride".</p>

            <p>There's also some personal things I should probably share here before ranting about them in posts, I am a diagnosed autist who suffers from depression and anxiety disorder - this has forced me to learn a lot about well-being, psychology, and lifestyles</p>
            <p>Finally, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world. And despite having our ups and downs, our overall relationship is nothing but incredible.</p>
            
            <p>So, in 4 words:</p>

            <div class="simple-image-container">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dngjvc3t6/image/upload/v1752498360/i_m-weird-and-sensitive-friends_lbe4hz.gif" alt="Anime GIF" loading="lazy">
            </div>

            <h2>My interests</h2>

            <p>My hobbies are as varied as my background, I've played the piano for well over 15 years by now (still a complete amature (╯︵╰,) ), I've been writing poems, songs and short stories for as long as I can remember. I grew up playing zelda with my father who knew nothing about video games at the time, Nintendo was a big part of my childhood. Anime is also taking a pretty big chunk from my free time.</p>

            <p>Thanks to my Wife I'm also literate in normies activities, like doomscrolling and reality TV shows. We have been together for quite a while and I have a lot to say about forming a healthy relationship.</p>

            <p>Regardless, we have many shared hobbies, including but not limited to - an undying love for ghibli movies, obsession with "modern" impersiosnist (they're all dead why do we still call them modern?), and an appreciation for a good tabletop game, like Catan or Splendor.</p>

            <p>I guess you could say my interests are almsot everything.</p>

            <div class="simple-image-container">
                <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dngjvc3t6/image/upload/v1752498554/annie-community_anwfol.gif" alt="Anime GIF" loading="lazy">
            </div>

           
            <h2>So what the f*ck is this place?</h2>

            <p>From Coding, to Anime - this site is a confusing place where I might publish a poem about leaves right after a ranking of Zelda's best fish (numer 1 is Sidon of course. Yes he is a fish. Do not argue or my Wife WILL look at you like this: (◞‸◟) )</p>

            <p>The name "Purple Pen" comes from the fact the my surname sounds a lot like "Purple" in my native tounge. People used to mock me but honestly the nickname grew on me.</p>

            <p>So why I opend this blog? You see there's just so much I want to say... <br> Without it being connected back to me. (≧▽≦)</p> 
            <p>This is my space to express my opinions freely without fearing I come across as condescending - because you don't know who I am! ＼(￣▽￣)／</p>

            <p>Thank you for checking out my blog, I hope you find something fun to read.</p>
